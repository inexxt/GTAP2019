\section{Introduction}

Permutations are pervasive:

\begin{itemize}
  \item quantum unitary operations; at their heart is a classical permutation
  \item hott: equivalences are core; when restricted to finite sets we talk about permutations
  \item Permutation-based cryptography \url{https://permutationbasedcrypto.org/2018/program.html} and \url{https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a780/6067e6fa3083ac946a9b2effd27d09ed6cde.pdf}
  \item other classical examples: \url{http://www.sfu.ca/~jtmulhol/math302/notes/302notes-May29-2015.pdf}
  \item Paper-folding \url{https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dcbf/ef94957a9cc3082db7bcb2e9aed5f8fc588a.pdf} and \url{http://news.mit.edu/2017/algorithm-origami-patterns-any-3-D-structure-0622}
  \item origami materials \url{https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041070}
  \item DNA \url{http://www.dna.caltech.edu/Papers/surface_CRNs_DNA20.pdf}
\end{itemize}

So how do you program with permutations? We develop a nice programming language in which every expression is a valid permutation; all permutations can expressed; includes sound and complete meta-programs for reasoning about permutations; can express compositions of permutations along sums and products; can transfer algorithms/proofs across several representations of permutations.
